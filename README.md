## 👋 Namaste! Hello!, 
## I'm Shubham Kumar!

A **persistent problem-solver** who enjoys the process of building things — usually a combination of optimized data pipelines, scalable APIs, machine learning models.

---
I enjoy being a **generalist**, but I make **concerted efforts** to continuously brush up on and stay updated with concepts and trends in:
   - **Server-side/Big-Data Engineering**  
   - **ML-Ops**  

I primarily work with **Python-based frameworks and libraries**, along with different flavors of **SQL**.

### 🛠️ **My Most Frequently Used Tools**
- ⚡ **PySpark** – Along with Pandas, NumPy, and other usual suspects in the world of data-wrangling and ETL-enabling APIs.  
- 🌐 **Flask/Django** – Experience with building APIs, but minimal use of ORMs.  
- 🔥 **PyTorch** – For building and training machine learning models.  
- 📚 **MySQL / MongoDB** – Working with both relational and NoSQL databases.  
- ☁️ **AWS Services** – Experienced with:  
    - S3  
    - DynamoDB  
    - Lambda  
    - Redshift  
    - Glue
    - ... and many many others.

### 🚀 **What I'm Currently Exploring**
- ML model deployment strategies.
- Low-latency APIs for big data processing.
- Distributed systems and efficient data pipelines.
- Integrating LLM-capabilties into existing workflows.
